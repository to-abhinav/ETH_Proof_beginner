# MyToken

This Solidity contract defines a basic token with mint and burn functions, allowing for the creation and destruction of tokens. The contract also keeps track of the total supply of tokens and the balance of each address.

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract enables the creation of a custom cryptocurrency token, allowing the owner to mint new tokens and increase the total supply, as well as burn existing tokens to reduce the supply. Additionally, it maintains a record of each user's token balance, enabling the tracking of token ownership and transfer.
